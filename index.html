            <h2 class="h2-titleme">About Me</h2> <br>
                <p class="p-me">Hello! My name is Freddy Kristian Putra, a 20-year-old Informatics student currently studying at Institut Teknologi Nasional Bandung. 
                    I have a strong passion for technology and software development, with a keen interest in learning and applying new programming 
                    languages, tools, and methodologies. <br><br>

                    Throughout my academic journey, I have gained solid foundational knowledge in computer science, including areas such as algorithms, 
                    data structures, databases, and software engineering. I have also worked on various projects that have helped me to hone my skills 
                    in coding, problem-solving, and teamwork. <br><br>
                    
                    In addition to my academic pursuits, I am always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on innovative projects. 
                    I believe that continuous learning and practical experience are key to personal and professional growth in the ever-evolving 
                    field of technology. <br><br>
                    
                    Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the projects I have worked on, and don't hesitate to get in touch if you'd like to collaborate 
                    or discuss technology!
                </p>
